            <p>Active learning and student-centered courses have been important goals for education research because
                they appear to provide better, more effective learning environments for students. This article provides
                ways to bring a student-centered perspective to online and hybrid courses. By using rhetoric and
                composition theories that inform critical pedagogical stances, the author calls for incorporating online
                writing spaces for students across the disciplines. </p>
